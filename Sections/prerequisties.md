# Prerequisites
What do you need to know/have before hand?
There's a few things to know and obtain before you get started!
## Downloads
You will need to download and install a zip file extraction tool, such as 7Zip or WinRar.
+ I personally use [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/fileadmin/winrar-versions/winrar/th/winrar-x64-602.exe).    

Next you will need a Text Editor such as Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code.
+ I personally use and HIGHLY recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win), it is light weight, versatile and overall a really good editor.
## Need To Know
For the basics on what we are doing you will need to know the following;   
+ How to operate a Windows computer.
+ How to Navigate to Directories/folders.
+ Specifically how to navigate to your Steam directory that contains the game.
  + If you do not know how to easily navigate to the steam directory, open Steam, right click on 7 Days to Die, click `manage`, then `browse local files`.
+ Remember for mods that you download from various websites, they will usually be in a compressed folder AKA Zipped up, you will need to use WinRar or 7Zip to extract/unzip them to get the actual mod folders out to use.
## Setting Up Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code has alot you can do, as such it can be used right out the box, however I would like to show you some things to optimize your efficiency.
+ Open the editor, you should be greeted with a Getting Started screen by default.
+ Open your 7 Days to Die steam directory. Now navigate to the `Data` folder, inside that folder should be a folder called `Config`.
+ Now that you have found that config folder, click and drag it into Visual Studio Code, let go and a dialog box should pop up saying `Add to Workspace` and one that says `Trust`, click Yes and trust.
+ Now on the top left click `File` and hit `Save Workspace As`, name it whatever you would like, for the sake of example we'll name it `modding` and save it to your Desktop.
+ At the top left of the editor once again click `File`, now click `Autosave`.
