# Installing Mods
You might be completely new to this, and if so, thats okay! It will be very simple and straight forward.   
## Steps
+ Step 1: Navigate to your 7 Days to Die steam directory, if you don't know how to navigate to this folder, open Steam, Right click on 7 Days to Die in your Library, then click Manage, then click `Browse Local Files`, if there is no folder here named `Mods`, create one.     
+ Step 2: Grab the mod folder from a mod you downloaded or created, and put it into the `Mods` folder in the 7DTD directory.
+ Your directory should now look similar to this:   
```c
steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\ModFolderHere
```   
*Note: Due to the The Fun Pimps changing how mods are loaded, these installation instructions will change soon*    
## Important
Remember when adding mods that you are checking what version of the game that mod was made for, ie: A mod made for Alpha 16 _probably_ won't work on Alpha 20.   
If you aren't careful with this, you run the risk of really messing up your world saves.    

Also if you run into a mod that _should_ be working but isn't, check that there *is* a file in the mod folder called `ModInfo.xml`, if there is not one that is why the mod has not been loaded, if the mod has been loaded but has is not functioning properly then it it likely that the mod needs uppdated for the game version.    

## Done
You now know how to install mods!
