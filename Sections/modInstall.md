# Installing Mods
You might be completely new to this, and if so, thats okay! It will be very simple and straight forward.   
## Steps
+ Step 1: Navigate to your 7 Days to Die steam directory, if there is no folder named `Mods`, create one there.
+ Step 2: Grab the mod folder from a mod you downloaded or created, and put it into the `Mods` folder in the 7DTD directory.
## Important
Remember when adding mods that you are checking what version of the game that mod was made for, ie: A mod made for Alpha 16 _probably_ won't work on Alpha 20.   
If you aren't careful with this, you run the risk of really messing up your world saves.    

Also if you run into a mod that _should_ be working but isn't, check the `ModInfo.xml` that comes in the mod folder.

## Done
You now know how to install mods!
